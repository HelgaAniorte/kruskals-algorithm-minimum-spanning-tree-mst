# Kruskal's Algorithm Minimum Spanning Tree (Graph MST)

Java Implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm using **disjoing sets**  
**Kruskal's algorithm:** Start with T = âˆ…. Consider edges in ascending order of weight. Insert edge e into T unless doing so would create a cycle
- Works on **UN-directed** graphs
- **Algorithm still works on edges with identical weight**  
Edges are sorted by weight first. Depending on the order they are entered into the **edge list** in the **constructor**, you may get different Minimum Spanning Trees (but all still optimal solutions)

## Code Notes
Current code runs on this sample graph

It produces this Minimum Spanning Tree

- Requires **distinct nodes named with consecutive integers**. If they really **do** have the same "name", convert them to integer ID's to use this algorithm  
Example graph has 8 nodes numbered 1-8 (array ignores the 0th index)
- **You must hardcode the graph structure in constructor** as a **list of edges**
- `graphEdges` is **indexed from 1** to make it more human-readable. In the constructor:  
`graphEdges=new ArrayList<Edge>();`  //creates empty ArrayList  
`graphEdges.add(new Edge(0, 0, 0));`  //adds dummy edge before any actual edges  
**The 0th index is ignored because the loop starts @ 1**
- `DisjointSet nodeSet = new DisjointSet(nodeCount+1);` also skips the 0th index by creating a Disjoint Set **1 larger than the number of nodes**
- **Make sure `nodeCount` is accurate**. There's no error checking between `nodeCount` & the actual edge list
- `outputMessage` is a string that records  the steps the algorithm takes. It's printed to the screen & to a file once complete
- My implementation has **early termination**. If a graph has **N nodes** the MST has **(N-1) edges**  
Hence `&& mstEdges.size()<(nodeCount-1)` in my loop
- The `Edge` class simply packages an edge's weight & 2 vertices together as 1 object
